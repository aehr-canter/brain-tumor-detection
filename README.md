# Brain Tumor Detection: Empowering Health Insights with AI 

![Brain Tumor Detection Banner](path/to/your/banner_image.png)

Welcome to the Brain Tumor Detection project! This initiative leverages the power of deep learning, specifically the DenseNet169 architecture, to classify brain MRI images as either containing a tumor or being tumor-free. Our goal is to contribute to faster, more accessible, and potentially more accurate initial screening processes, ultimately supporting better health outcomes.

This project is designed to be open-source and serves as a strong foundation for further development. We are particularly excited about the potential for this work within initiatives that promote women in AI and healthcare technology.

## ‚ú® Project Goals ‚ú®

*   Implement a robust image classification model using transfer learning.
*   Provide a clear, well-structured codebase for understanding and modification.
*   Offer a baseline model that can be improved upon for various applications.
*   Serve as an educational resource for learning about CNNs and medical image analysis.
*   **Act as a springboard for projects in women-centered AI competitions**, focusing on aspects relevant to women's health or participation.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Special Invitation: Women in AI & Healthcare üë©‚Äçüíª

This project warmly welcomes contributions from everyone, but we especially encourage women in technology, data science, and healthcare to get involved! If you are looking for a project to contribute to for a women-centered competition, or simply want to learn and build skills, this is a great place to start.

We believe that diverse perspectives are crucial for building inclusive and effective healthcare solutions. Your unique insights can help shape the future development of this tool.

## üöÄ Further Implementation Ideas for Women-Centered Competitions üöÄ

Here are some ideas to extend this project, particularly relevant for a women-centered competition. These could be fantastic project scopes!

1.  **Focus on Specific Tumor Types/Locations:** Research and incorporate datasets focusing on brain tumors that might present differently or have varying prevalence in women compared to men.
2.  **Address Data Bias:** Investigate and mitigate potential biases in the dataset (e.g., if the dataset is not representative of diverse populations, including different genders). This could involve data augmentation strategies or exploring fairness metrics.
3.  **Develop an Intuitive User Interface:** Create a simple web or mobile application where a user (perhaps a medical professional or even a patient with guidance) could upload an image and get a prediction. Design the UI with accessibility and user-friendliness in mind, potentially tailoring it for use in women's health clinics.
4.  **Integrate with Electronic Health Records (EHR):** (More advanced) Explore the potential for integrating this AI tool into simulated or real-world (with appropriate permissions and considerations) EHR systems to streamline workflows.
5.  **Educational Tool:** Build an interactive application or module that explains how the AI model works, using visualizations. This could be aimed at educating young women about AI's role in healthcare.
6.  **Explore Explainable AI (XAI):** Implement techniques to understand *why* the model makes a certain prediction (e.g., highlighting regions in the image that are most indicative of a tumor). This can build trust and provide valuable insights to clinicians.
7.  **Collaborate with Healthcare Professionals:** If possible, connect with radiologists or oncologists to get feedback on the model's performance and usability in a real-world clinical context.
8.  **Focus on Resource-Constrained Settings:** Adapt the model for deployment on less powerful hardware or in areas with limited internet connectivity, which can be particularly relevant for improving healthcare access globally, impacting women disproportionately in some regions.

These are just starting points! Feel free to explore other avenues based on your interests and the competition's theme.

## üñºÔ∏è Dataset üñºÔ∏è

The model is trained on the [Kaggle Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection). This dataset contains MRI images categorized into 'yes' (tumor) and 'no' (no tumor).

**Before running the code, you need to:**

1.  Download the dataset from the Kaggle link provided.
2.  Extract the dataset files.
3.  Update the `main_directory` path in the `config.yaml` file to point to the location where you extracted the dataset.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

1.  **Clone the repository:**

(Replace `your-username/your-repo-name` with the actual repository details)

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Make sure you have Python and `pip` installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
    # Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to Run üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

1.  **Update `config.yaml`:** Ensure the `main_directory` path in `config.yaml` is correctly set to your dataset location. You can also adjust other training parameters in this file.

2.  **Run the main training script:**

The script will load the configuration, prepare the data, build and train the model (initial training and fine-tuning), and evaluate its performance. Training progress, plots of accuracy and loss, and a confusion matrix will be displayed.

## ü§ù Contributing ü§ù
